            Shechinah - Letting divine power work through the user that is manifested outside
            their control. They have limited to no control at all over it. (Miracles, Resurrection)

            Tehuti - Power manifested through the laws of physics. Not outside of the user's control
            but within the user and outisde. Always in control because the laws are understood need only
            manipulation. (Technology)

            Magick - This is power stolen or manifested from an outside source that might not always be
            understood through conventional means. However, this power is more or less evokation rather
            than self. Manifestation of things that are beyond control, enslaved by control, manipulated 
            or outright co-oped with to make of strength through pacts and contracts. This can often be 
            mistaken for Shechinah because of the similarities but it is only power through that which 
            controls the user forcefully or manifests this magick power by way of divination 
            and other practices. (Spells, Incantations, pacts.)

            Seinshin - Its basically the force. it can come from the self, the world and pretty much 
            everything.
